## Introduction

Supabase is an open source platform that provides a set of tools and services for building modern web and mobile applications. It is a baaS (backend as a service) that is built on top of Postgres and provides a set of APIs that can be used to build applications. It is seen as a free and open source alternative to Firebase and was built for developers who want to build applications without having to worry much about the backend. Supabase also has a paid tier that provides additional features, more storage, more bandwidth and more services called Supabase Pro.

## Brief History

- November 2020: Supabase was launched publicly as an open source project

- March 2021: Supabase added support for real-time subscriptions making it possible to build real-time applications like chat apps

- June 2021: Supabase announced a partnership with Vercall to provide a full-stack development experience.

- Novermber 2021: Supoabase auth was released, providing authentication services for web and mobile.

- January 2022: Supabase passed 100,000 users.

- February 2022: Supabase Actions is introduced, allowing developers to build and automate workflows.

- October 2022: Supabase-js v2 and Supabase-flutter are released.

## Features

- **Database**: Built on top of Postgres, Supabase provides a database service that can be used to store data. It also provides a set of APIs that can be used to query the database. The database service is free and open source and can be self-hosted. With Supabase pro it also offers additional features, more storage and more bandwidth.
- **Serverless**: Deisgned to be serverless, Supabase is able to provide a set of services without having to worry about the backend infrastructure. Since its built on cloud infrastructure, it is able to scale automatically. Their functions can be called with a variety of languages and frameworks.
- **Framework and Language Support**: Supabase supports a bunch of frameworks and languages. They offer client libraries for Javascript, Flutter/Dart, Python and C# with the last two being created and mainted by memebers of the Supabase community. They also offer quickstart guides for many of the most used frameworks like React, vue, NextJS and many more.
- **Authentication**: With Supabase, developers can easily add authentication to their applications. It provides a set of APIs that can be used to add authentication to your application. It also provides a set of UI components that can be used to build a login and signup page. They also have samples already made for different frameworks and languages you can build from. It supports a variety of authentication methods including email, other social media platforms, multi-factor autchentication and passwordless authentication. It also sends emails to users when they sign up or reset their password.
- **Real-time subscriptions**: A key feature of Supabase is the ability to build real-time applications. It provides a set of APIs that can be used to subscribe to changes in the database by specifying the table and the columns you want to subscribe to. The updated data is sent in real time making it possible to build applications like chat apps and multiplayer games to name a few.

## Strengths

### Open Source

Supabase is open source and free to use. This means that developers can help make Supabase better by contributing to the project. It also means that developers can self-host Supabase and have full control over their data. This is a big advantage over other platforms which is not open source and does not allow developers to self-host for this reason.

### Easy to use

One of Supabase's deisgn philosophies is to make it easy to use with simple but powerful tools. It is designed to be used by developers of all skill levels. It is also designed to be used by developers who are not familiar and don't want to worry about backend. The UI is simple and easy to use and community support is available to help developers get started. The documentation is also good and gets updated regularly.

### Real-time subscriptions

As mentioned on features, Supabase provides a set of APIs that can be used to subscribe to changes in the database. This feature alone makes developers want to use Supabase. It is one of their key features and makes it one of their strengths for this reason.

### Authentication

Supabase authentication services being super competetive and modern with similar baaS platforms makes it a big strength for Supabase. You can add authentication to your application with a few lines of code and it supports a variety of authentication methods including email, other social media platforms, multi-factor autchentication and passwordless authentication. It can also sends emails to users when they sign up or reset their password.


### PostgreSQL

Since its built on top of postgreSQL, Supabase is reliable while being powerful. PostgreSQL gives developers the power to build complex applications while being secure. It is also open source just like Supabase making it pair well. PostgreSQL is actively maintained with a large user base and is one of the most popular database types in the world.

### Easy migration

Supabase makes it easy to migrate from other platerforms to Supabase. They have guides on hwo to migrate from many of the big platforms. If your application needs something that Supabase provides, you can easily migrate to Supabase.


## Weaknesses

### Limited features

Some features are still missing from Supabase. They are still working on more features but they are released without being production ready. Them releasing features that are not production ready is good for people who want to try out the features but it is not good for people who want to use the features in production and might need to wait for them or use a different platform.



### Supabase is the new kid on the block

Supabase is still a new platform and is not as popular as its competitors. It is still in its growing phase and maybe not as mature as its competitors. Even though it is still in its growing phase, it is mostly production ready. Changes can happen rapidly fast and it might not be as stable as its competitors. 

## Comparison

### Firebase

Firebase is the main platform to compare Supabase to. Supabase is advertised as a "open source Firebase alternative." Firebase is owned by Google and have been around since 2011 and bought by Google in 2014. Firebase is also a baaS (backend as a service) and since it has been around for way longer, it has a way larger community. Firebase is also more mature and has more features than Supabase. Firebase is not open source and does not allow developers to self-host. This is a big disadvantage for firebase and an advantage for Supabase. The free plan on Firebase is also limited and does not provide as many features as it does over on Supabase.

Firebase has a few extra limitation on infrastructure and customizing features compared to Supabase which allows excellent control over infrastructure and since it is open-source. With Firebase being owned by google it is often seen as the go-to platform for bigger companies because of the Google infrastructure and support. Supabase on the other hand is great for small to medium businesses and startups. 

Both Firebase and Supabase has their pros and cons. Its hard to say which on is better since both platforms are great. If you are looking for a platform that can give you all the freedom and control you want, Supabase is the way to go. If you are looking for a platform that is more mature and has more features, Firebase is the way to go. Often the decision comes down to what you are looking for and what you need or you prefer.

## Summary

 Supabase is a BaaS (Backend as a service) that provides a free tier with reasonable options, is built on top of Postgres, and is fully open-source.
 It offers impactful features to make your backend experience easy. To name a few they offer real-time subscriptions, authentication, and support for multiple coding languages and their frameworks. The platform is designed to be user-friendly for new and experienced developers, and you can even host it yourself if you want. Supabase compares itself to Firebase, which is similar but lacks the open-source aspect and doesn't allow self-hosting because of this. However, Firebase has a larger community and more features. Supabase is still relatively new and has some limitations, but it's strong points makes it a good alternative to other platforms especially for smaller to medium projects/buisnesses. Despite being the new kid on the block, Supabase is quickly gaining a following and expanding its features. It's a great option for developers who want to use postgreSQL and not have to worry about the backend.
